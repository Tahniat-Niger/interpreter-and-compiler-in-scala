For this assignment 02, I added all the codes in the interpreter and compiler file where it was required. I was able
to complete all the functionalities and test with my custom test.bl file and also for the interpreter tested it with
the given TestILI and TestILI2. And it passed all the test cases. And for the compiler also, I tested the TestILC and 
TestILC2 and the compiler also passed all the test cases.

Difficulties I faced in this program are, 
in the interpreter, other operations except for was easy or same as the last assignment. For operation was not that hard
too. it's just about following all the instructions that you have added in the requirement pdf file. I just took more time 
than others and had to check the condition for looping in different ways.

in the compiler, after the arithmetic operations, others were tricky. But after finding out for one, for example, Lt, the Eq and Gt 
got easy. And using the Lt, Gt, Eq others was solvable to check the looping condition and other conditions. If and For one again 
took more time to find out step by step.

For the EvalOrder, took a lot of time to figure out how to call functions in function in scala. There was something call by name
that I used. But I don't know why I took a lot of time for this one to figure out.

Overall, initially, it seems hard but after solving step by step it gets easier and also fun to solve.
